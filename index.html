    <h1>Hey Baby</h1>
    <br>
    <p>First of all, I want to say sorry for the things I have put you through in the last 5 months. I don't know what's wrong with me, maybe I had missed playing around but it breaks my heart to see you cry. <br> To be honest that is the moment I feel my emotions moved, waaah siwezi vumilia kuona ukilia</p>
    <h2>You can be visiting this webpage whenever you miss me</h2>
    <br>
    <p>we've known each other since 2019-2020 na kumbe it was fate bringing us together again. And this time imetuseparate tena kunipa chance ya kuproof ni wewe nadai zeeka naye</p>
    <h3>Dating YOU</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Nilitakanga kukudate since huko 2nd year, & dammnit, it turned out even better than I had anticipated, fuck. I already miss those lips <br>
    I have never told you this, but nikiwa nawe my inner child huwa at peace, I love how you are feminine, and kind to kids. CONCEIVE PLEASE <br>
The little games we play when we are together pia hufanya nakumiss maze, nafeel so free nikiwa nawe adi huwa sinotice time inasonga. Nakupromise I will look for that transport juu chini nimake sure urudi huku, siwezi tolerate the distance, nafeel inanisuffocate</p>
    <h4>QATAR</h4>
    <p>Please do not look at this kama leaving, you have gone to stay with your sister for some time while I look for the transport back. I can't take the distance mazee, na wewe kuishia imefanya nimegundua nakupenda na huwa I take it for granted juu uko close</p>
    <p>I will be updating this page as time goes by</p>
